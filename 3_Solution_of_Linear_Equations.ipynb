    "The figures above illustrate the difference between the geometry of consistent systems (left) and inconsistent (right) systems. If we think of a linear system as a set of lines then they either cross once (unique solution for $\\m{x}$), are identical (infinite solutions for $\\m{x}$), or do not cross at all (no solution for the unknown $\\m{x}$). In the latter case the coefficient matrix will be singular i.e., $\\text{det}(\\m{A})=0$. If the lines do cross there is a solution, thus $\\text{det}(\\m{A})\\neq 0$. Note that in 2-D space with 2 equations the inverse usually exists, unless the equations represent parallel lines. However, in $n$-Dimensional spaces with $n>2$ and $n$-equations it will be the exception for the inverse to exist.\n",

    "<img align=\"left\" width=\"50%\" style=\"padding-right:10px;\" src=\"./Images/2_identical_1_separate.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "What may be observed from the figure is that though there are three equations in $\\m{A}$ two of them are identical in terms of geometry, resulting in two rather than three lines. In this case we would expect there to be a unique solution for $\\m{x}$. However since $\\m{A}$ is not a square matrix $\\m{x}$ cannot be determined by the matrix product $\\m{A}^{-1}\\m{b}$  and must be determined from [105](#eq105) i.e., $\\m{x}=\\left(\\m{A}^T\\m{A}\\right)^{-1}\\m{A}^T\\m{b}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We also must use [105](#eq105) for the case where we have multiple lines that have a common intersection such as the non-homogeneous system with\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\m{A}=\\begin{pmatrix}2&3\\\\4&3\\\\8&7\\end{pmatrix}\\tag{112}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "In this case the lines are all different, but share a common intersection i.e., a unique solution for $\\m{x}$ exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ocean mapping we often make several observations to determine where we are. We can often represent these observations by straight lines and if we have exactly as many observations as unknown we can determine uniquely were we are. However, there is error associated to the observations, so the unique estimate $\\m{x}$ will contain some level of error. If we add more observations to improve our results we will run into the issue that there will not be a unique intersection, in this case [105](#eq105) will usually still yield an estimate for $\\m{x}$ known as the ***least squares estimator***. The topic of least squares estimation is extensive and is addressed in detail in [Learning Least Squares]()\n",

    "### 3.2.2 Computation of Systems Having a Unique Solution Without Computing an Inverse\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At this points some remarks about the relationship between the solution of linear equations and the computation of an inverse are on order:\n",
    "\n",
    "On the one hand, as noted in [2.3.6 Inverse of a Matrix: Computation](2_Matrix_Algebra.ipynb#Inverse_of_a_Matrix_Computation), the computation of an inverse can be formulated as the problem of solving a non-homogeneous system of linear equations with a unique solution. A specific numerical method for computing the inverse of a symmetric matrix, based on this formulation (the Choleski algorithm may be found in [6 Choleski Method](6_The_Choleski_Method.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand ([107](#eq107)) implies that the solving a non-homogeneous system of linear equations with a unique solution involves the computation of the inverse $\\m{A}^{-1}$. In fact, numerical techniques for solving linear equations need not require explicit computation of an inverse. Numerical methods can either be *iterative* or *direct*. Iterative techniques begin with an initial approximation (to the solution), and use a suitable converging process to successively refine this approximation. Iterative techniques are suited to simple implementation on a computer, where they are relatively insensitive to round-off errors. Direct methods yield the exact solution (in the absence of round-off error) in a finite number of elementary arithmetic operations. Direct methods are usually based on the concept of **matrix decomposition** (also known as **matrix factorization**), in which the initial matrix $\\m{A}$ is first transformed in the product of two or more other matrices having certain special properties. The [Choleski algorithm](6_The_Choleski_Method.ipynb) first decomposes the initial matrix in the product of a lower triangular matrix $\\m{L}$ and its transpose $\\m{L}^T$ i.e., $\\m{A} = \\m{L}\\m{L}^T$. \n",

    "Direct solution of linear equations without explicit inversion involves three steps:\n",

    "- Elimination of some elements of unknown vector $\\m{x}$ from the system\n",
    "- solution for the smaller system\n",
    "- back substitution to solve the eliminated elements of $\\m{x}$\n",

    "$$\\begin{array}. x_1 &-& 2x_2 &+& x_3 &=& 1\\\\ 2x_1 &-& 3x_2 &+& 4x_3 &=& 5 \\\\ 2x_1 &-& 5x_2 &+&2x_3&=& 1\\end{array}\\tag{114}$$\n",
    " \n",
    " Applying the three steps, we eliminate $x_1$ by subtracting twice the first equation from the second equation, and by subtracting the third equation from the second equation, to obtain:\n",
    " \n",
    "$$\\begin{array}. x_2 &+& 2x_3 &=& 3\\\\ 2x_2 &+& 2x_3 &=& 4 \\end{array}\\tag{115}$$\n",

    "We solve this system bottom to top. From the first equation $x_3 = 1$. Back substituting this in the value for $x_3$ in the second equation we obtain $x_2 = 1$, back substituting these values for $x_2$ and $x_3$ into the first equation we obtain $x_1=2$.

    "The code cell above illustrates the simplicity of direct solution of linear equations without explicit inversion, perhaps deceivingly so. Deceiving for two reasons: 1) the complexity of determining the inverse is hidden by calling the `linear algebra` `inv` function, and 2) the example used here was chosen to be consistent, non-homogeneous and, with a unique solution. We could generalize the code easily, as a matter of fact: in the code above the first steps of generalization are already done by determining the rank of $\\m{A}$ and $\\m{Ab}$ and, evaluation of $\\m{b}$ for the number of solutions. \n",

    "In least squares approximation and estimation the explicit computation of an inverse matrix is usually desired, because of its relationship to the statistical properties of the solution (the inverse matrix calculated is the covariance matrix of the unknown $\\m{x}$ -  we will address this in detail in [Learning Least Squares](). For this reason the least squares solution (such as ([105](#eq105)) is usually determined by explicit inversion of, in this case, $\\left(\\m{A}^T\\m{A}\\right)^{-1}$. However, for systems of equations large enough to strain the storage capacity of the computer being used, an elimination process similar to the one illustrated above is more practical than explicit inversion. In this case the matrix inversion required for the covariance matrix (or at least parts of its inverse) can be determined afterwards."

For a proper experiment there should be more equations than unknowns i.e., more observations than unknowns. Due to observation errors these equations will be inconsistent. Therefore rather than attempting a direct solution of these solutions we apply the least squares criterion and formulate the **normal equations**:\n",

We therefore have a non-homogeneous, consistent system of normal equations with a unique solution given by:\n",
