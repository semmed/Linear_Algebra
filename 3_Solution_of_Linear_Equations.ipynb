    "The figures above illustrate the difference between the geometry of consistent- (left) and inconsistent (right) systems. If we think of a linear system as a set of lines then they either cross once (unique solution for $\\m{x}$), are identical (infinite solutions for $\\m{x}$), or do not cross at all (no solution for the unknown $\\m{x}$). In the latter case the coefficient matrix will be singular i.e., $\\text{det}(\\m{A})=0$. If the lines do cross there is a solution, thus $\\text{det}(\\m{A})\\neq 0$. Note that in 2-D space with 2 equations the inverse usually exists unless the equations represent parallel lines. However, in $n$-Dimensional spaces with $n>2$ and $n$-equations it will be the exception for the inverse to exist.\n",

In this case we would expect there to be a unique solution for $\\m{x}$. However since $\\m{A}$ is not a square matrix $\\m{x}$ cannot be determined by the matrix product $\\m{A}^{-1}\\m{b}$  and must be determined from [105](#eq105) i.e., $\\m{x}=\\left(\\m{A}^T\\m{A}\\right)^{-1}\\m{A}^T\\m{b}$\n",

    "In ocean mapping we usually make several observations to determine where we are. We can often represent these observations by straight lines and if we have exactly as many observations as unknowns, we can determine uniquely were we are. However, there is error associated to the observations, so the unique estimate $\\m{x}$ will contain some level of error. If we add more observations to improve our results we will run into the issue that there will not be a unique intersection, in this case [105](#eq105) will usually still yield an estimate for $\\m{x}$! This result is known as the ***parametric least squares estimator*** $\\hat{\\m{x}}$. The topic of least squares estimation is extensive and will be addressed in detail in [Learning Least Squares]()\n",

    "### 3.2.2 Computation of Systems Having a Unique Solution Without Computing an Inverse\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point some remarks about the relationship between the solution of linear equations and the computation of an inverse are on order:\n",
    "\n",
    "On the one hand, as noted in [2.3.6 Inverse of a Matrix: Computation](2_Matrix_Algebra.ipynb#Inverse_of_a_Matrix_Computation), the computation of an inverse can be formulated as the problem of solving a non-homogeneous system of linear equations with a unique solution. A specific numerical method for computing the inverse of a symmetric matrix, based on this formulation is the Choleski algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand ([107](#eq107)) implies that the solving a non-homogeneous system of linear equations with a unique solution involves the computation of the inverse $\\m{A}^{-1}$. In fact, numerical techniques for solving linear equations need not require explicit computation of an inverse. Numerical methods can either be *iterative* or *direct*. Iterative techniques begin with an initial approximation (to the solution) and use a suitable converging process to successively refine this approximation. Iterative techniques are suited to simple implementation on a computer, where they are relatively insensitive to round-off errors. Direct methods yield the exact solution (in the absence of round-off error) in a finite number of elementary arithmetic operations. Direct methods are usually based on the concept of **matrix decomposition** (also known as **matrix factorization**), in which the initial matrix $\\m{A}$ is first transformed in the product of two or more other matrices having certain special properties. For example the aforementioned Choleski algorithm first decomposes the initial matrix in the product of a lower triangular matrix $\\m{L}$ and its transpose $\\m{L}^T$ i.e., $\\m{A} = \\m{L}\\m{L}^T$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Direct solution of linear equations without explicit inversion involves three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Elimination of some elements of unknown vector $\\m{x}$ from the system\n",
    "2. Solution for the smaller system\n",
    "3. Back-substitution to solve the eliminated elements of $\\m{x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we have the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{array}. x_1 &-& 2x_2 &+& x_3 &=& 1\\\\ 2x_1 &-& 3x_2 &+& 4x_3 &=& 5 \\\\ 2x_1 &-& 5x_2 &+&2x_3&=& 1\\end{array}\\tag{114}$$\n",
    " \n",
    " Applying the three steps, we eliminate $x_1$ by subtracting twice the first equation from the second equation, and by subtracting the third equation from the second equation, to obtain:\n",
    " \n",
    "$$\\begin{array}. x_2 &+& 2x_3 &=& 3\\\\ 2x_2 &+& 2x_3 &=& 4 \\end{array}\\tag{115}$$\n",
    " \n",
    "To eliminate $x_2$ from these two equations we subtract the second from twice the first row to obtain\n",
    " \n",
    "$$\\begin{array}. 2x_3 &=& 2\\end{array}\\tag{116}$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "This completes the elimination step. We now have a triangular system, constructed by taking one of the original three equations (say the first) of (114), one of the two equations (say the first) of (115) and the final equation (116) to obtain: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{array}. x_1 &-& 2x_2 &+& x_3 &=& 1\\\\   & & x_2 &+& 2x_3 &=& 3 \\\\   & & & &2x_3&=& 2\\end{array}\\tag{117}$$\n",

    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{pmatrix}1&-2&1 \\\\ &1 & 2 \\\\ & & 2\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 2\\end{pmatrix}\\tag{118}$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "We solve this system bottom to top. From the first equation $x_3 = 1$. Back substituting this in the value for $x_3$ in the second equation we obtain $x_2 = 1$, back substituting these values for $x_2$ and $x_3$ into the first equation we obtain $x_1=2$. Note that the only explicit matrix inversion here was solving for $x_3$, a scalar division.\n",

    "In least squares approximation and estimation the explicit computation of an inverse matrix is usually desired, because of its relationship to the statistical properties of the solution (the inverse matrix calculated is the covariance matrix of the unknown $\\m{x}$ -  we will address this in detail in [Learning Least Squares](). For this reason the least squares solution (such as ([105](#eq105)) is usually determined by explicit inversion of, in this case, $\\left(\\m{A}^T\\m{A}\\right)^{-1}$. However, for systems of equations large enough to strain the storage capacity of the computer being used, an elimination process similar to the one illustrated above is more practical than explicit inversion. In this case the matrix inversion required for determining the covariance matrix (or at least parts of its inverse) can be determined afterwards."
