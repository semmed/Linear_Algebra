    "\n",
    "Linear algebra is a recently developed branch of mathematics. Although some of its concepts are much older, modern linear algebra originated in the nineteenth century. Its key tool, the matrix, dates to 1850. Arthur Cayley's development of matrix multiplication and inversion a few years later, coupled with WR Hamilton's work on vector spaces, laid the foundations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear algebra deals with problems that can be formulated in terms of linear equations. A linear equation in two or more variables contains no products between the variables, or powers of the variables beyond the first power. The term *linear* comes from the fact that the graph of a linear equation in two variables $x, y$ is a straight *line* in the $xy$ plane. This is one example of the strong connection between *geometry* and linear algebra.\n",

For example, the length of a vector is a scalar function of something, a vector, which is not a scalar; $\\sin{\\theta}$ is a scalar function of the scalar value ($\\theta$). "
